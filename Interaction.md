* [DNMT3L connects unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 to de novo methylation of DNA (Ooi 2007)](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7154/full/nature05987.html)
  - Dnmt3L is repelled by H3K4me3
  - Dnmt3L recognizes histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at lysine 4 and induces de novo DNA methylation by recruitment or activation of DNMT3A2
