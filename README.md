## Reviews: X chromosome inactivation
* [X inactivation and the complexities of silencing a sex chromosome (Chow and Heard, 2009)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955067409000982)  includes an examination of the sequence of epigenetic events accompanying the silencing of the X chromosome during differentiation. 
* [X-inactivation, imprinting, and long noncoding RNAs in health and disease (Lee and Bartolomei, 2013)](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2813%2900205-5)
 

## Epigenetics and Evolution

#### General
* [Molecular basis of base substitution hotspots in Escherichia coli (Coulondre, 1978)](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/355893): spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine 
* [The evolution of invertebrate gene body methylation (Sarda, 2012)](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/8/1907.short) analyzed methylation levels of orthologs from four distantly related invertebrate species. 
* [Gene body methylation is conserved between plant orthologs and is of evolutionary consequence (Takuno and Gaut, 2013)](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/5/1797.short)

#### Mammals
* [A genome-wide study of DNA methylation patterns and gene expression levels in multiple human and chimpanzee tissues (Pai et al. 2011)](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001316.g004) suggested that DNA methylation plays a highly conserved tissue-specific role in human and chimpanzees. 
* [The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo-and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores (Irizarry et al. 2009)](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v41/n2/abs/ng.298.html) CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin.
* [Divergent whole-genome methylation maps of human and chimpanzee brains reveal epigenetic basis of human regulatory evolution (Zeng et al. 2012)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929712004107): Levels and patterns of DNA methylation vary across individuals within species according to the age and the sex of the individuals. Differentially methylated genes are strikingly enriched with loci associated with neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and cancers.
