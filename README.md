## Epigenetics and Evolution

#### General

* [The evolution of invertebrate gene body methylation (Sarda, 2012)](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/8/1907.short) analyzed methylation levels of orthologs from four distantly related invertebrate species. 
* [Gene body methylation is conserved between plant orthologs and is of evolutionary consequence (Takuno and Gaut, 2013)](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/5/1797.short)

#### Mammals
* [A genome-wide study of DNA methylation patterns and gene expression levels in multiple human and chimpanzee tissues (Pai et al. 2011)](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001316.g004) suggested that DNA methylation plays a highly conserved tissue-specific role in human and chimpanzees. 
* [The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo-and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores (Irizarry et al. 2009)](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v41/n2/abs/ng.298.html) CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin.
* [Divergent whole-genome methylation maps of human and chimpanzee brains reveal epigenetic basis of human regulatory evolution (Zeng et al. 2012)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929712004107): Levels and patterns of DNA methylation vary across individuals within species according to the age and the sex of the individuals. Differentially methylated genes are strikingly enriched with loci associated with neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and cancers.
* [Dynamics of DNA Methylation in Recent Human and Great Ape Evolution (Hernando-Herraez et al. 2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003763) used Illumina Methylation450 BeadChips to profile DNA methylation genome-wide in blood-derived DNA from a total of 9 humans and 23 wild-born individuals of different species and sub-species of chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan, (1) methylation values recapitulate the known phylogenetic relationships of the species (2) a significant positive relationship between the rate of coding variation and alterations of methylation at the promoter level
* [The interplay between DNA methylation and sequence divergence in recent human evolution](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/17/8204) WGBS data; whole blood; human, chimp, gorilla, orangutan; We identified 8,952,000 CpG positions shared among the four species in autosomal chromosomes, this data set was used for further analysis. (1) inferred TFBS in human-specific DMRs, using the CENTIPEDE algorithm; observed a significant increase in the frequency of human-specific substitutions in predicted TFBS compared with TFBS in the background set (2)the acquisition of DNA hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these CpG sites

## Population Epigenetics
* [Population epigenetics. (Richards. 2008)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18337082) A review. 


#### Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
* [Epigenetic inheritance at the agouti locus in the mouse. (Morgan et al. 1999)](http://www.nature.com.libproxy.usc.edu/ng/journal/v23/n3/full/ng1199_314.html) showed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance resulted from incomplete erasure of an epigenetic modification.
* [Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic states at the murine Axin(Fu) allele occurs after maternal and paternal transmission. (Rakyan et al. 2003)](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2538.long) found that the methylation state of Axin-Fu in mature sperm reflects the methylation state of the allele in the somatic tissue of the animal, suggesting that it does not undergo epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis.
* [Germline epimutation of MLH1 in individuals with multiple cancers. (Suter et al. 2004)](http://www.nature.com.libproxy.usc.edu/ng/journal/v36/n5/abs/ng1342.html) reports two individuals with soma-wide, allele-specific and mosaic hypermethylation of the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1.  **Epimutation inheritance and cancer**
* [Inheritance of a cancer-associated MLH1 germ-line epimutation. (Hitchins et al. 2007)](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa064522)
  
  > The transmission of epialleles in humans continues to be a topic of debate. The authors provide evidence for transmission of a silenced and hypermethylated epiallele of the tumor suppressor gene MLH1 in a human pedigree.


#### Natural epigenetic variation
* [DNA Methylation Profiling of the Human Major Histocompatibility Complex: A Pilot Study for the Human Epigenome Project. (Rakyan et al. 2004)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC529316/)
  
  > "Our analysis of DNA methylation levels within the major histocompatibility complex ... reveals a bimodal distribution of methylation profiles, tissue specificity, inter-individual variation, and correlation with independent gene expression data."
* [X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females (Carrel and Willard. 2005)](http://www.nature.com.libproxy.usc.edu/nature/journal/v434/n7031/full/nature03479.html): about 15% of X-linked genes escape inactivation to some degree. An additional 10% of X-linked genes show variable patterns of inactivation and are expressed to different extents from some inactive X chromosomes.
* [Widespread Monoallelic Expression on Human Autosomes. (Gimelbrant et al. 2007)](http://www.sciencemag.org.libproxy.usc.edu/content/318/5853/1136)
  
  > assessed allele-specific transcription of about 4000 human genes in clonal cell lines and found that more than 300 were subject to random monoallelic expression. ... Unexpectedly widespread monoallelic expression suggests a mechanism that generates diversity in individual cells and their clonal descendants. 
* [Comparing the DNA hypermethylome with gene mutations in human colorectal cancer. (Schuebel et al. 2007)](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030157):the number of epigenetically inactivated genes in a tumor cell is much larger than the number of genes disrupted by mutations.
* [Heritable rather than age-related environmental and stochastic factors dominate variation in DNA methylation of the human IGF2/H19 locus.(Heijmans et al. 2007)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17339271): ***Genetic source***
  
  > "variation in DNA methylation of the IGF2/H19 locus is mainly determined by heritable factors and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cis, rather than the cumulative effect of environmental and stochastic factors occurring with age."
* [An association between variants in the IGF2 gene and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: interaction between genotype and epigenotype. (Murrell et al. 2004)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14645199) ***Genetic source***
